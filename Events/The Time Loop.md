When [[Cruentus 'Vinnie' Vinificus]] died he sent the world back in time 3 days in a 10 mile radius from where he died using [[Chronix]]. This caused a time loop until a timeline was reached where he didn't die. The [[The Outsiders]]s eventually ended the loop by saving [[Cruentus 'Vinnie' Vinificus]]'s life but now they remain in a timeline that is not their own, corrupting reality. (There are now two copies of [[Cosimo]], [[Dr. Lee Sung]], [[Nicolai Kadnikov]], and [[Franchesca]] in the world though the non-outsider [[Franchesca]] died.)
