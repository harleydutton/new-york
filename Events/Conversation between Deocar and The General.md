A conversation between [[The General]] and [[Deocar]] on the way to [[Times Square]] during the events of [[The Duel]], as overheard by [[Hasan]].

Deocar - You know where Jack keeps it. 
Washington - Yes. [[Vinnie|Diviciacus]]' prison is in the city. No I won’t tell you. 
Deocar - Why?
Washington - I’ve told you. Until Jack and the Outsiders meet final death he will not be free and the Mantle will remain broken. 
Deocar I’ve helped you find the Liar. I’ve placed him in your grasp. All you need to do is finish it.
Washington - He is but one. They all must be found and eradicated.
Deocar - Jack is not from the Outside.
Washington - Irrelevant. He spawned them. He must end.
Deocar - They are drawn to him. You could use him to bait them.
Washington - No, every second he lives Jack is a danger to us all. Also, I still don’t believe you that he isn’t one. Even Bluetrail sees it.
Deocar - She is a child and sees only the partial truth.
Washington - A child with the soul of Saul.
Deocar - Yes and even he could only see part of the tale.
Washington - I don’t believe you. Tonight I will kill Jack Vallens and bring about truth in this forsaken city.
Deocar - No. You will fight him. You will take his life and damn my father. For Diviacus to live so to must Jack. 
Washington - THEN LET HIM BE DAMNED! I listened to the dreams of the witch queen. I know his failure to prevent this! Let him go Deocar! Walk free to your master! Join my people in freedom! 
Deocar - You are but a slave with slaves. I at least choose my master. If you fight Jack and kill him, I will see the ruin of your people. 
Washington - TRY IT SLAVE! I will burn this world before I let you reign. 
Deocar - Then let's go warrior. Let the fates decide.
