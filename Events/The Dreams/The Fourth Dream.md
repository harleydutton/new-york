You wake above the clouds and see a Buddhist temple in the sky. You hear chanting and bells and drums. The sky is black, even below the floating temple. The temple is beautiful with infinitely complex painted walls and stained glass windows. You move toward the courtyard and see black haired angels playing music in robes. Twenty great trees with differently colored, unrecognizable fruit stand in the courtyard before the temple. Among the trees is a throne and a man dressed in east Asian garb sits upon it. Statues of gods kneel before him. The man ritually picks one of each fruit (in a familiar order) and places them in various statues' hands and they begin coming to life. The last of these is a pregnant woman. The man upon the throne  says "I the ruler command you to go down and create it!" The woman walks to the sky-well, in the center of the courtyard and jumps down into the void below holding a golden fruit. There is a flash as she disappears and the sun rises and the earth comes into view. The woman is seen again, no longer pregnant and with golden eyes she says, "Behold, I awaken"
