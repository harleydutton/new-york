The dream takes place in [[Central Park|The Park]] in the far-flung past. There are 20 or so children with reptilian features and brightly colored eyes. The dark then the white eyed children begin pouring their magic into the ground which begins heaving and forms a volcano. Third, the gold eyed child begins pouring it's magic into the volcano. All the other children begin pouring their magic into the ritual. As they finish, time stops, the sun and sky fade and the stars become visible, and the gold eyed child addresses [[The Dreamers]] and says "Behold, I awaken."
