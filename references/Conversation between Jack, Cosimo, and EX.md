This conversation between [[Jack]], [[EX]], and [[Cosimo]] was overheard by [[Chud]] after sneaking onto [[Jack's Submarine|Jack's Boat]] and hiding in the Scrooge Mc Duck pile of [[Blood Coins]] during the events of [[The Duel]].

Jack - WHAT THE FUCK!?
EX - This is your own doing. 
Jack - Like fucking hell! Do you think I'm stupid?!? I know this is EXACTLY what you planned and I am NOT your fucking pawn! 
Cosimo - Oh prince of lies. You are EXACTLY his pawn. 
Jack - SHUT THE FUCK UP DEAD MAN! You are a prisoner in this every bit as much as me and I at least have a choice. 
Cosimo -  HA! Then CHOOSE if you dare. 
EX - Cease Outsider. You absolutely have a choice Jack. As ever the choice is the same, live or die. 
Jack - That isn’t a choice, it's a sentence. 
EX - Semantics. 
Jack - Stake me. Stake me for a thousand years. You fight him. I can’t win. I don’t fight fair for a reason. I’m a 7th gen scumbag trying to avenge a dead man. 
EX - (Startled) The truth Jack? And wrapped in a lie. Masterful. You got your revenge thirty years ago. You literally broke the world and let in demons from nowhere to do it and now you simply seek to drag out the punishment. 
Jack - NO! I seek to win by surviving. [[Vinnie|Vinnie]] would just laugh and find another way to make his way back. 
EX - How Jack? You’ve trapped him. 
Jack - You don’t know him. You haven't fought him. He’s still there and his stupid fuck kids are going to find a way to get him back. It's their purpose. It’s exactly why he made them. He beat Lilith and got his ultimate power and now he’s just waiting for the right time to assemble the pieces and make the world his own broken plaything. I WON’T LIVE UNDER THE REIGN OF THAT FUCK PSYCHOPATH! 
Cosimo - Dear god. You blind fool You play a better wounded Ahab than the greatest pretender. 
EX - SILENCE DEMON! Jack you’ll never beat [[Vinnie|Diviciacus]] because you won’t stand before him and fight to win. You lie. You maneuver. You trick. You are a walking testament to the chaotic failure that Diviciacus has wrought on the world. You use the oldest and truest methods of failure. His own deeds. There is only one true way to win. To fight. 
Jack - You mean to die.
EX - Perhaps. I don’t think you know what you truly are. A seventh generation scumbag who stands in the face of the horrors of the night and bend them to your will. People truly believe you are unkillable. You don’t see it but you are on the cusp of actual victory over the unjust. All you have to do is fight, win and not tell a lie. 
Jack - HA! Just like ole Generous George huh. Fight, win and give it all up. 
EX - Yes 
Jack - Hypocrite! If that were the truth then why don’t you kill him and then go watch the sunrise. 
EX - I’m beyond that death, my friend. I am destined for a different death; a death of the mind. Besides, it can’t be me. It must be one of you to break the wheel. George tried and failed. He can’t give it up. 
Jack - Die for what I believe? How does that solve anything? 
EX - For you it solves nothing. For everyone else it would be a gift of freedom. 
Cosimo - HA! 
Jack - When will you teach me to kill him? 
EX - When you agree to die for the honor.
